<h2>About the Website</h2>
<p>
Hey there! My name is Marcopolo, and when I thought about making this website, I thought:<br>"What if I was making a website <i>for</i> the Ghostbusters?"<br>
I wanted to apply my newfound web development knowledge while having fun with this project, and I feel like I succeeded in both regards. In this site, you'll find all sorts of neat features such as buttons, image links, and much more. On your left, there's even a "News" column that scrolls with you!<br>
I hope that the design and function of this website appeal to you, dear viewer... And maybe also the actual Ghostbusters~
